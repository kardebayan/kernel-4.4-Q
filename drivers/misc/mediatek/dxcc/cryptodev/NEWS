* Added support for composite AEAD keys by Cristian Stoica.

* Added support for sysctl to modify verbosity by Nikolaos Tsakalakis.

* Several bugfixes by Cristian Stoica.

* When a driver requires aligned data but unaligned are provided, then
  zero copy is disabled to prevent driver failing to encrypt.

* Compatibility to kernel version 3.13 and above by Cosmin Paraschiv.

* Various checkpatch.pl fixes.

* Introduced ddebug, dinfo, dwarning and derr macros wrapping dprintk.

* Improved support for cross-compiling.

* Hmac_comp test has become more picky when checking results.

* Fixed allocated resource cleanup in error case, patch by Cristian Stoica.

* Buffer size allocation fixup for AEAD modes by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.

* Support for composite AEAD keys added by Cristian Stoica.

* Fixed tag and dsl_len calculation for AEAD ciphers, patch by Cristian Stoica.

* Documentation updates by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.


Version 1.6 (released 2013-03-20)

* Added modules_install target in Makefile

* Added SHA224. Patch by Yashpal Dutta.

* Asynchronous operations will not be scheduled if zero copy is disabled.

* Asynchronous operations are disabled by default, unless -DENABLE_ASYNC 
  is enabled on Makefile.


Version 1.5 (released 2012-08-04)

* Fixes in AEAD support. Patches by Jaren Johnston.

* Simplifications in memory locking. Patch by Phil Sutter.

* Allow empty plaintext and authenticated data in AEAD  ciphers. 
  Patch by Jaren Johnston.


Version 1.4 (released 2012-03-15)

* Correctly report hw accelerated ciphers.


Version 1.3 (released 2012-02-29)

* Return EBADMSG instead of ECANCELED on tag verification failure in 
  authenc modes.

* COP_FLAG_RESET can be combined with COP_FLAG_UPDATE for efficiency.

* Added more test cases.

* Automatically set public permissions for the device


Version 1.2 (released 2012-02-24)

* In kernels that do not distinguish between hw accelerated ciphers or 
  not set the SIOP_FLAG_KERNEL_DRIVER_ONLY flag based on driver name.

* camelia was renamed to camellia.

* Added COP_FLAG_RESET to allow resetting the state in multi-update.

* Corrected issue in ARM processors with mv_cesa.


Version 1.1 (released 2012-02-20)

* Fixed alignment issue in speed.c

* Defined HASH_MAX_LEN in cryptodev.h

* CIOCGSESSINFO ioctl() sets the SIOP_FLAG_KERNEL_DRIVER_ONLY flag if the 
  driver is only available through kernel driver (and is not just software 
  cipher).

* Added new encryption ioctl, CIOCAUTHCRYPT, which combines authentication 
  and encryption. Operates in AEAD, TLS and SRTP modes (the API might change
  in later versions).

* Several fixes in the included examples. Based on patches by Vladimir 
  Zapolskiy.

  - hashcrypt_speed additionally encrypts with AES128 and AES256

* Allow updating the IV in userspace via the COP_FLAG_WRITE_IV flag.

* Export the alignmask in an OCF compatible way.

* Fix for kernel crash on passing incorrect session ID.

* Added CIOCGSESSINFO to export additional information for each session.

* multi-update support for hash calculation using the new flag 
  COP_FLAG_UPDATE.

* Relicensed under GPLv2.

* Added AES-CTR.

* Corrected fallback to non-zero copy when referenced pages were 
  not writable.


Version 0.5 (released 2010-07-06)

* Corrected issue with zero copy on multiple pages.

* Fallback to normal operation if user pages cannot be mapped.


Version 0.4 (released 2010-07-03)

* Internal engine supports operations with zero copy from user space. 


Version 0.3 (released 2010-06-19)

* Corrected bug when initializing unsupported algorithms.


Version 0.2 (released 2010-06-18)
